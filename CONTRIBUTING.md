# How to contribute

### 1.Fork this repo

Go to the [main page](https://github.com/Dev-Soumyaranjan/Java-Coding-Questions) of this repo and there you will find a fork button at its right upper corner. Click
on that fork button then you will navigate to your github account.

### 2.Make clone of the repo

After navigating to your github account at right side of this repo you will find a drop down button "Code" click on that button then there you will find a clone link,just
copy that link.Then open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to keep this repo and then run the following command:

```

### 3.Open this folder in your favourite code editor

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and you can use any code editor of your choice.
If you use VS Code after applying all the above steps when you open your folder in VS Code then you will see like thisüëá

## 4.Make a new branch

As you can see in the above picture of vs code the default branch selected for the repo is "main"(At left down corner).
Use the following command to create a new branch

```bash

 git branch Branch_Name
 
```

Now set the [HEAD](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2304087/what-is-head-in-git#:~:text=The%20HEAD%20in%20Git%20is,the%20next%20commit%20you%20do.) to new branch by runnig following command:


```bash

 git checkout Newly_Created_Branch_Name
 
```


### 5.Make a new program or make changes to the existing code

Now create a new program or you can also make changes in existing code.


### 6.Commit the code

Run the following command to [commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_(version_control)) the code‚ÜóÔ∏è

```bash

 git commit -m "Commit Message"
 
```

### 7.Push the changes

Run the following command to [push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_(version_control)) the code to your newly created branch in the foked repo‚ú®

```bash

 git push origin "Newly_Created_Branch_Name"
 
```

Note: Don't push code directly to the main branch. Never do itüö´

### 8.Make a pull request

After pushing the new code(new file) or code changes(changes in existing file) to your new branch
Open your browser and go to your forked repo in your github account.There you will see a section "Pull request" like below imageüëá

<img src="https://github.com/Dev-Soumyaranjan/Dev-Soumyaranjan/blob/main/Assets/Repo_Menu.png" alt="Repo_Menu">

Click on that and then you will see an option "New pull request" at right side. And when you will click on that "New pull request" button you will be then
redirected to this main repo pull request section and you will see the page like belowüëá

<img src="https://github.com/Dev-Soumyaranjan/Dev-Soumyaranjan/blob/main/Assets/Pull%20request.png" alt="Pull request">

Here at the place of 1 your name will appear and at place 2 your branch name will appear.Now just click on "create pull reqeust" button.
Basically place 1 refers to the repository in your github account which you have forked and place 2 refers to the branch in which you made changes(Creating new file
or making changes in existing file)

üöÄIn short here,you are requsting to merge the changes which you have made in your branch to the main branch of this repository.üöÄ

## Points to remember

i. Each time follow the same step to make a pull request(Step [4](###4.Make-a-new-branch) to step [8](###8.Make-a-pull-request))

ii. Make a separate branch each time for each program.Because you can't create multiple pull request in one branch.If you want to know more about it then click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apGV9Kg7ics?&t=2785)
