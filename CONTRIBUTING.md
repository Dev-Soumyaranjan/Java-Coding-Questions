## What should I know before I get started?

### Basics of java

We have already mentioned all resources in this repo's [README.md](https://github.com/Dev-Soumyaranjan/Java-Coding-Questions/blob/main/README.md) to gain the 
fundamentals of java programming language.We request you to go through those resources inorder to get the fair idea about java basics as it is very necessary for 
java journey.

# Basics of git and github

In the same way we have also added some resources to learn git and github in this repo's [README.md](https://github.com/Dev-Soumyaranjan/Java-Coding-Questions/blob/main/README.md).
Kindly go through those mentioned resources for gaining overall idea about git and github also how to contribute in open source.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Suggesting Enhancements
This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion this repository, including completely new programs and minor improvements to existing programs.
Following these guidelines help maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create 
one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). 

##### Fill the following template inorder to create a new issue
  * Fill this for [wrong output](https://github.com/Dev-Soumyaranjan/Java-Coding-Questions/issues/new?assignees=Dev-Soumyaranjan&labels=wrong+output&template=wrong-output.md&title=Wrong+output)
  * Fill this for [update documentation](https://github.com/Dev-Soumyaranjan/Java-Coding-Questions/issues/new?assignees=Dev-Soumyaranjan&labels=documentation&template=update-documentation.md&title=Update+documentation)
  * Fill this for [other issue](https://github.com/Dev-Soumyaranjan/Java-Coding-Questions/issues/new)
  
#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).After you've determined [which program]([#atom-and-packages](https://github.com/Dev-Soumyaranjan/Java-Coding-Questions))
your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue for that that and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples 
  as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current result of the code** and **explain which which result you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the program which the suggestion is related to.
* You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.

### Your First Code Contribution

Refer [How-to-Contribute file](https://github.com/Dev-Soumyaranjan/Java-Coding-Questions/blob/main/How-to-Contribute.md) in order to make your first code contribution.The step by step process
is mentioned on that file which will help you for making your first code contribution.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain quality of this repository.
- Fix problems that are important to prorammers.
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible to provide quality code with clear explanation.

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](https://github.com/Dev-Soumyaranjan/Java-Coding-Questions/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional code optimization, 
code enhancement with comment, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add prgram" not "Added program")
* Use the imperative mood ("Add new code to..." not "Adds new code to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * :new: `:new:` when adding new code
    * :sparkles: `:sparkles:` when optimizing the code
    * :page_facing_up: `:page_facing_up:` when adding more documentation to the program for increasing the readability of the program
