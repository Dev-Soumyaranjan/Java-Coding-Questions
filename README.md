1. First learn Java fundamentals
- Find some resources below:

3. Determination

    As you know it plays vital role to achieve anything in life. From now promise yourself that you
    will push yourself every day without losing hope. Be stay with “Never give up attitude”. It is true
    that it will take some time to grab the coding logic. Remember the more you practice coding 
    questions more your logical thinking ability will increase.
    
4. Consistency(Most important)

   Do you know why most of the people started programming but do not last long and give up?
   breaking consistency is the main reason behind it so be careful for it. Don’t break consistency
   by any chance. At least do one coding question per day.
   
 ## 🔥Highlight Points
  - You will find every coding question's answer with proper explanation.
  - Start with very basic level questions and gradually increase the difficulty level.
  - If you find any program wrong or unexplained or needs some improvement then create issue for it.
  - Feel free to share and discuss any coding questions which is coming to your mind in [discussion page](https://github.com/Dev-Soumyaranjan/Java-Coding-Questions/discussions).



## ✌️Contributing

<img align="right" alt="Coding" width="400" src="https://github.com/Dev-Soumyaranjan/Java-Coding-Questions/blob/main/images/dcsad.gif">

- Fork this repo

<img src="https://github.com/Dev-Soumyaranjan/Java-Coding-Questions/blob/main/images/Fork.png">

- Clone the forked repo from your github account to your local machine

<img src="https://github.com/Dev-Soumyaranjan/Java-Coding-Questions/blob/main/images/Clone.png">

- After cloning & setting up the local project you can push the changes to your github fork and make a pull request.

- You can also checkout our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Dev-Soumyaranjan/Java-Coding-Questions/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to know how to contribute.
    

## 🎗️Keep in mind before contributing
- Adding comment in code is mandatory.Otherwise  program will not be acceptable.
- Comment should be crisp and clear which can make one able to understand the logic of the program.

  See the below example which is justifying above two lines:

## 📌 Pushing the changes
<img align="right" alt="Coding" width="400" src="https://github.com/Dev-Soumyaranjan/Java-Coding-Questions/blob/main/images/code-push.gif">

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: added new stuff"
git push origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME

Then create pullrequest

```

Recommendation:


Create separate branch for each program to make pull request. And delete the branch after the  merging of correspondence code with main branch of this repo.
Remember that you should not push code directly into main branch.

Here I have made two branches
